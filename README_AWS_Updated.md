Use the following guide to deploy DShield honeypot onto the free compute tier (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/?did=ft_card&trk=ft_card). This guide uses Ubuntu as Amazon has deprecated AWS Linux AMI (https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-ami/#:~:text=The%20Amazon%20Linux%20AMI%20will,long%20term%20support%20through%202023.)

5. Create a new network security group and give your home public IP (in case you have a static IP address from your ISP.) If you do not have static IP address and want higher security 


6. Launch the instance and login via SSH:


7. Optional: If you're going to directly ingest logs for analysis set hostname for your honeypot using:

sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "hostname"


8. Make sure the OS is updated
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y


9. You will have to install Python2, Python-pip, git [may be installed by default] manually.
